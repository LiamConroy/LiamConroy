Hi I'm Liam Conroy, I am an aspiring Web/Game Developer currently studying my final
year of Creative Computing in IADT.

Many of the larger projects that I have completed throughout my course can be found here! 

Feel free to have a look around and if you have issues downloading repos do let me know.
